# Other / Experimental Assets

This directory contains experimental work, prototypes, and projects that don't fit other categories.

## Required Assets

### Current Placeholders Needed:
1. **placeholder.png** (400x225px)
   - Generic placeholder for experimental work
   - Should have neutral design or "Coming Soon" text

## Adding New Experimental Assets

1. Export your work at 400x225px (16:9 aspect ratio) for thumbnails
2. Use descriptive kebab-case filenames: `my-experiment-name.png`
3. Update `src/data/creations.ts` with the new entry in the `OTHER` array

## This Category is For:
- Early-stage prototypes
- Experimental techniques
- Cross-disciplinary work
- Work-in-progress previews

## Recommended Formats
- **PNG**: Best for experimental/mixed media
- **JPG**: For photographic experimental work
- **GIF**: For simple animated experiments

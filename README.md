## 👋 About Me

I'm **Kenzuu**, a creative developer and designer based in the Philippines who thrives at the intersection of **technology, art, and storytelling**. My work spans elegant code, immersive animations, and atmospheric soundscapes—all driven by a belief that the most compelling digital experiences emerge when technical precision meets creative expression.

**What I Do:**
- 🎨 Craft **interactive web experiences** with modern frameworks
- ✨ Create **anime-inspired animations** and motion graphics
- 🎵 Produce **electronic music** and soundscapes for multimedia projects
- 🚀 Build **full-stack applications** that solve real problems

**Core Philosophy:**  
Technology should be a canvas for creativity. Every line of code is an opportunity to tell a story, every animation a chance to evoke emotion, and every project a step toward pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm.
